This is a knowledge base of questions and answers for AI interview preparation, and of paper summaries for AI research. 
Tex files from papers are stored in the Sources folder and include the full text of the paper. [used_sources](Sources/used_sources.md) lists the papers already parsed for the knowledge base. Summaries for each paper/algo should contain 1 <algo>.md file with a high-level overview targeting human readability and understanding, and 1 <algo>_detailed.md file with technical details and pseudocode that should allow a human or LLM agent to implement the algorithm from scratch without the full paper. 
When given a folder in Sources, check if it's been parsed already. If not, parse it, create and populate the <algo>.md and <algo>_detailed.md files, and add it to used_sources.md.
