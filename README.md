## 📥 Data Acquisition: ArXiv to Local

Papers in the `Sources/` directory are acquired using [arxiv_download](https://github.com/TemplierPaul/arxiv_download). This tool downloads ArXiv TeX sources and cleans them for LLM grounding.

### Prerequisite: Start the Server (Docker)
Ensure the output directory is set to `/Users/ptemplie/Documents/ICLVault/Sources` in `docker-compose.yml`.
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Usage
1. **Load Extension**: Load `extension/manifest.json` as a temporary add-on in Firefox (`about:debugging`).
2. **Download**: Go to an ArXiv page (e.g., [1901.01753](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01753)).
3. **Trigger**: Click the extension icon, type a folder name (e.g., `poet`), and hit **Enter**.
4. **Result**: A new folder in `Sources/` with raw TeX and a `_full_paper_context.txt` ready for LLM use.

## 🎓 Key Differences: Learning vs Questions

| Aspect | Learning/ | Questions/ |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Purpose** | Knowledge base, research | Interview preparation |
| **Format** | Essays, detailed notes | Q&A, structured answers |
| **Depth** | Variable (overview + deep-dives) | Comprehensive but focused |
| **Code** | JAX implementations | Python/C++ examples |
| **Audience** | Self, LLM agents, researchers | Interview candidates |
| **Organization** | By research topic | By interview domain |
| **Style** | Exploratory, detailed | Concise, practical |

**When to use Learning/**: Understanding concepts deeply, research projects, implementing algorithms
**When to use Sources/**: Grounding LLMs with raw paper data, RAG applications, extracting specific text
**When to use Questions/**: Interview prep, quick review, systematic coverage of topics

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Using the Learning Folder
- Start with high-level `.md` files for overview
- Dive into `_detailed.md` for implementation depth
- Use as reference while coding projects
- Great for grounding LLM agents with domain knowledge

### Using the Questions Folder
- Follow structured study paths in READMEs
- Practice coding examples from scratch
- Focus on understanding, not memorization
- Use role-specific checklists for targeted prep

### Combining Both
1. Learn concept in `Learning/` (deep understanding)
2. Practice with `Questions/` (interview format)
3. Implement algorithms from `Learning/` (hands-on)
4. Review Q&A in `Questions/` (reinforce)
