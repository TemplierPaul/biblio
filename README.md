# ICLVault: Machine Learning Research Knowledge Base

Welcome to **ICLVault**, a comprehensive personal knowledge base focused on advanced Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, and Evolutionary Optimization. This vault serves as both a research reference and a study guide for research scientist interviews.

## 📂 Vault Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

### 1. `Learning/` (Active Knowledge Base)
The core of the vault. Contains structured notes, study guides, and deep dives.

- **[[Learning/Learning.md|Learning.md]]**: The main entry point and index for all topics.
- **[[Learning/STUDY_GUIDE.md|STUDY_GUIDE.md]]**: A progressive curriculum forinterview preparation.
- **[[Learning/INTERVIEW_ANSWERS.md|INTERVIEW_ANSWERS.md]]**: Detailed answers to study guide questions.

**Key Topics:**
- **Game Theory**: Self-play, AlphaZero, PSRO, NeuPL, CFR, Nash Equilibrium.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: World Models, RL Algorithms (MPO, CrossQ), RNN Policies.
- **Evolutionary Optimization**: Quality-Diversity, MAP-Elites, NEAT.
- **JAX Tools**: Ecosystem guide for JAX, Flax NNX, Flashbax, PGX, QDax.
- **Machine Learning**: Transformers, LLMs, Diffusion, etc.

### 2. `papers/` (Literature Catalog)
A catalog of relevant research papers.
- **[[papers/by_topic.md|by_topic.md]]**: Papers organized by research area.
- **[[papers/index.md|index.md]]**: Chronological or general index.

### 3. `biblio/` (Archived)
Legacy notes and literature reviews.
> ⚠️ **Note**: This directory is **superseded** by `Learning/`. Content has been migrated to the active knowledge base. It is kept for archival purposes only.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start with the Index**: Open **[[Learning/Learning.md]]** to see the full scope of topics.
2. **Follow the Study Guide**: If preparing for interviews, follow **[[Learning/STUDY_GUIDE.md]]**.
3. **Explore Deep Dives**: Look for `_detailed.md` files (e.g., `PSRO_detailed.md`) for implementation-level details of key algorithms.

## 🛠️ Stack & Tools

- **Obsidian**: Recommended for viewing (notes use WikiLinks `[[...]]`).
- **JAX Ecosystem**: Code examples use JAX, Flax NNX, and related libraries.
